      To self host a desired font, you must first find a font that you like.
      There are many places to find open-source fonts, and more if you feel like
      paying for them. Once you find one that you like, download the font in any
      of the common file formats for fonts such as .ttf, .otf, .woff, etc.

      Then, this file needs to be uploaded to the web server, where it then can be
      used. In a css file, or using internal CSS (like here) add the rule "@font-face"
      and then the font-family rule within that, along with a src rule describing the
      file location of the desired font. The font-family rule is a human legible name
      used for reference.
