      <p class="bodyPara">
	Software Architecture, often confused with <a class="bodyLink" href="SoftwareDesign/">Software Design</a>, is the process of designing a structure of a system.[synopsis] The software architecture can be seen as a kind of blueprint for a set of <a class="bodyLink" href="Requirements/">requirements</a>. Or another way, it is how the highest level components of a system work together.[martinfowler] Choosing a Software architecture occurs separately from implementation, and consists of making nonfunctional decisions.[tutorialspoint] Software Architecture is also referred to as a system's architectural style. 
      </p>
      <p class="bodyPara">
	There are countless software architectures, and each have their own benefits that impact quality, such as <a class="bodyLink" href="PerformanceMetrics/">performance</a>, <a class="bodyLink" href="SoftwareMaintenence/">maintainability</a>, cost, and other attributes of software engineering.[synopsis] Often, when determining which architecture to implement, it is important to notice the non-functional requirements of the system. A software engineer with notice the quality attributes that are mandatory for a system, and design or implement an architecture matching these attributes.[medium] A good choice architecture is seen to reduce the overall cost of a system, in terms of work-hours spent, over the course of several weeks.[martinfowler]

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>
      
      <p class="bodyPara">
	In the abstract, software architecture originates in the 1960's, as software began to increase in complexity. Before this time, systems were small enough to not bother with a complex abstraction. As systems grew in size, it became reasonable to construct more complex descriptions regarding the function of a system. Many broke down these more complex descriptions into four layers, with the lowest layer being implementation, and the highest layer being the software architecture.[psu.edu]
      </p>
      <p class="bodyPara">
	The term began to gain traction in the 1980's, and the first book that discussed software architecture explicitly, and as the main focus was in 1990.[psu.edu]

      <h2>Types of Software Architecture</h2>
      <hr>

      <p class="bodyPara">
	There are many different types of computer architecture, each of which have their own benefits and trade-offs. Each one is useful in the right scenario. The following are examples of some of the most popular Software Architectures. 
      </p>
      <ul class=bodyList>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="Monolith/">Monolithic Architecture</a>: The most common architecture, often chosen by default. The entire system is in the same <a class="bodyLink" href="Repository/">repository</a> and available to all developers. </li>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="Microservices">Microservices</a>: A more novel architecture that is picking up traction with newer web developers such as Netflix. Focuses on breaking a large system into smaller, individually releasable services.</li>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="Layered">Layered Architecture</a>: Focuses on breaking the program into groups of sub tasks, generally into four "layers:" the Presentation layer, the Application layer, the Business logic layer, and the Data access layer.[towardDataScience]</li>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="EventDriven">Event-driven Architecture</a>: Focuses on reacting to given data, whether that is a keystroke, a mouse-click, or other. Popular with web services, especially those developed with JavaScript.[techBeacon]</li>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="SOA">Service Oriented Architecture</a>: Breaks an entire company into smaller services for the purpose of code re-use and project velocity.[Cite that one article]</li>
	<li><a class="bodyLink" href="Reactive">Reactive Architecture</a>: Develops for changes in the system, in order to facilitate responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven, services.[Dzone]</li>
