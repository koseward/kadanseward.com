      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p class="bodyPara">
	Requirements, also known as user requirements, or software requirements are descriptions of the functionality of a given system. There are two primary types of requirements: functional and non-functional requirements. The former are what the system should do - whether it searches through items, does an operation, or completes a task. Non-functional requirements describe how a system completes the functional requirements. These are wide ranging, from security requirements, to how an app will communicate with outside structures.

      <h2>Relation to Software Architecture</h2>
      <hr>

      <p class="bodyPara">
	Requirements are an important part of choosing an appropriate architecture. A set of requirements are necessary before any choice can be made, as that list informs which characteristics are important for the system to have. Then a decision can be made as to what architecture is most effective.
