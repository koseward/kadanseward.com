      <p class="bodyPara">
	The Reactive Architecture is a <a class="bodyLink" href="../">software architecture</a> that focuses four main traits: being responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven. It was developed as a response to the ever-increasing requirements of modern software. [1] A reactive architecture should be able to function, even if parts of the system are unresponsive. The system must also be able have parts that can function in many different contexts. [2]
