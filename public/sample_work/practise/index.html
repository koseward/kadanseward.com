      "p" is for paragraphs. Did you know html isn't whitespace sensitive?

      If you want to break text on purpose you can't just preess enter
      <br>You have to use the "br" tag

    <p title="Dummy there was no secret">
      Apparently, if you hover over this text a secret will appear?

      Now that was serious
    </p>
    <pre class="poem">
      Now when I press enter it does mean something
      This is a new line :)
      This is useful for poetry. Example:
      The smoke covers all
      Ash rains down from the dulled sky
      It's snowing on Mt. Fuji
    </pre>
    <p id="textTypes">
      There will be a bunch of weird text here
      <b>Bolded</b>
      <strong>Important</strong>
      <i>Italicized</i>
      <em>Emphasized</em>
      <mark>Marked? I wonder what this will look like</mark>
      <small>Teeny text</small>

      And now, some quoted text: <br>
      A great man once copypastad: <br>
      <blockquote cite="https://copy.r74n.com/copypastas">
        My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my
        mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate,
        you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he
        realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three
        years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me.
        My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family
        through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have
        never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of
        regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.
