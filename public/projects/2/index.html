        What if one billion dollars could be pushed into the economy without any
        side effects whatsoever? It would be wondered why this hasn&#39;t been
        accomplished already. This is because it would mean that the United States
        would have to stop minting the penny. This isn&#39;t the first time the United
         States discontinued one of its coins, there is precedent.
         The half penny was discontinued in 1853 due to its lack of value. The
         same should be done for the penny because it is a significant economic
          drain on the mint, as well as the people who use them. Despite its
          popularity, the one cent coin of the United States no longer has value
          in our monetary system and needs to be discontinued.
        </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">Effects on the Government</h1>
      <p>
        When money was based on the gold or silver standard, coins had the value
         of its composite metals. The value of one penny was how much its weight
        in copper was worth, which was roughly one one-hundredth of a dollar
        (which was worth a predetermined amount of gold). After the United States
         discontinued the gold standard, the coins still needed a value. Instead
        of the coin being the value of its metals, it became a representative
        value, much like paper notes. The United States mint could now make money
       on the coins produced. The amount of value generated through minting
       is called seigniorage. As an example, a one USD note costs about 10
        cents to manufacture, so the seigniorage on that dollar is 90 cents.
        When there is profit on the production of a coin, it makes sense for
       the mint to keep producing the coin. In the case of the penny,
       however, this hasn&#39;t been the case for more than fourteen years<span class="superscript">[3]</span>.
       The following table shows the cost of producing pennies for one
      year:

      <p>
        The first thing to note is the difference between the gross cost of the
        product versus the value of the one cent coins being produced. Although
         80.6 million dollars was created in 2018 through the creation of pennies,
          it cost the mint 166.1 million. Such a transaction results in 85.5
           million dollars of loss. Further, that means that each penny costs
            approximately 2.1 cents to make. It is also important to note that
            the nickel incurs negative seigniorage, at the value of 33.5 million
             a year.
      </p>

        The purchase of materials and production of coinage falls on the US
        government. Whose budget comes from taxes. In that respect, everyone who
         pays taxes in the US pays essentially a tax in order to subsidize the
          value of the penny, so that instead of being worth 2.1 cents, it is
          instead worth 1.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">The Cost to the Individual</h1>
      <p>
        Last time I was at the grocery store, I was standing in line, waiting to
        check out at the self check-out machines. Despite no one visibly having
        very many items to scan and pay for, each time it took what I thought to
        be an unreasonably long time to process some of the transactions. I
        started to pay attention to those who lagged at the register. The fiddling
        with coins seemed to be one of the holdups, along with machine illiteracy.
        The self help registers didn&#39;t seem to be easy to use with customers,
        plus the customer had to find the coins in the first place. When they
        searched through their belongings for their pennies and dimes, it took
        away from time that another customer could have been checking out, and
        getting back to whatever they needed to be doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an important idea in economics, and a damning effect of the penny.
        It is called opportunity cost, and it states that something is done,
        something else could be done instead. So instead of the people spending
        time to fiddle with change, they could have instead been out of the store,
        getting work done or otherwise increasing the value of the world around
        them. Now, the average wage in the United States is about 18 dollars an
        hour, meaning that one second of work costs about half a cent. That the
        average wage of a sales clerk is about 9.60, meaning that each second they
        work is worth about a third of a cent. In 2001, there were an estimated
        106 billion transactions every year in the United States, 36.3 percent of
        them involving pennies. The amount of transactions has certainly
        increased, but the percentage of transactions involving pennies have
        decreased, effectively canceling it out<span class="superscript">[6]</span>. Taking this number, times the
        amount of time it costs to fiddle with pennies, which can be taken to be
        about two and a half seconds considering the time of the clerk, the
        customer and the people in line, a total of ninety-six billion seconds
        are wasted annually. Multiply this by the sum of the wage of the cashier
        and the customer, and the opportunity cost totals 733.5 million dollars
        per year<span class="superscript">[6]</span>. Without the penny, all of this time is spent doing more
        productive endeavors.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">Fallen into Disuse</h1>
      <p>
        The penny has such little purchasing power, and is so insignificant in
        regards to value, that many people in younger generations have already
        limited their use of the coin and coins in general. According to a survey
        I conducted which asked respondents how recently they have used a penny
        in their recent cash transactions, and whether or not they had a penny on
         their person. In response to the first question, more than sixty percent
         of respondents had neglected to use a penny in a cash transaction in more
          than one year, and thirty percent of people had not used a penny in more
           than five years. This is despite the fact that one hundred percent of
            people who responded to the survey have made a cash transaction in
            the last month.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is one thing to not use the coins, but it is even more telling that
        most people did not have a penny on their person:
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="img.png" alt="Pie Chart of Penny Carriage">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">Figure 2: Whether respondents had a penny on their person or not</p>
      <p>
        Despite the currency being money, and even though this is the most printed
         coin that the United States manufactures<span class="superscript">[3]</span> a large majority of people do
          not carry them to use and facilitate commerce. Where is all of this
          money then? For many, their spare change, primarily pennies, is stored
           away in coin jars, never to be exchanged again.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why are pennies not used in day-to-day transactions? When asked, there
         were many telling responses. One responder mentioned that, <q>they&#39;re
         completely inconvenient. The inability to estimate a good&#39;s actual price
          due to the addition of sales tax at [the] point of sale makes them
          unusable, in my experience.</q> Without knowing how much something costs
          beforehand, consumers naturally shy away from options that waste time
          for themselves and others. Another answerer replied, <q>Having to dig
          through my bag to find pennies is really annoying, so I always end up
          just rounding up to the nearest dollar, giving me even MORE coins which
           just continues the cycle.</q> The fact that this person has can make
           change, and still feels unable to is indicative of the problem. It is
           not a matter of not having the ability to carry all of the coins, but
            using them is problematic as well. So much so that it&#39;s more worth it
             to carry them around for no reason than to spend them.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">Following by Example</h1>

      <p>
        The United States is not the only country to have such problems with their
         lowest-denomination coin. Many countries have also forsaken their one
         cent piece including the Eurozone, Australia, New Zealand, and even our
          northern neighbor, Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Zealand has gone further than many of the other countries as they have
         not only eliminated their one cent coin, but also their five cent piece,
          favoring a decimal coinage system. Their reasoning was quite elegant -
           it was no longer profitable. According to the New Zealand Reserve Bank,
            <q>Critical to the decision (to remove our lowest denomination coins)
            was the cost of manufacture of the 1 cent … coin: … it cost 1.6 cents
             to manufacture a 1 cent coin!</q><span class="superscript">[1]</span> For the five cent piece, the Bank
             describes the coin as a <q>nuisance</q> and as having, <q>no real value</q> to
              the people of New Zealand due to inflation<span class="superscript">[2]</span>. The United States is
              capitalist through and through, so an endeavor that is no longer
              profitable makes sense to stop. But perhaps New Zealand is not similar
               enough to the US to compare the two?
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at Canada, which is the most similar to the United States, in
           geography, history, and economic policy might offer insights to the
           rationale behind the decision. The economists Danu Chande and Timothy
           Fisher of Wilfrid Laurier University analyzed the cost of the Canadian
            Penny in 2003 to conclude that printing of the coin should stop, for
            many of the same issues outlined above for the US penny:
      </p>
      <p>
          First, the negative seigniorage that the penny caused for the Royal
          Canadian Mint is noted. Each penny, in 2000 and 2001 respectively, cost
          4.95 and 3.95 cents to manufacture. This led to an overall loss of over
          50 million dollars between the two years. The opportunity cost, or user
           cost, as referred to in the journal, was also calculated. Chande and
           Fisher estimate that the time cost for using pennies is approximately
           1.5 seconds as opposed to transactions without pennies. Assuming that
           in Canada there are more than 40 million transactions per day, there
           would be an opportunity cost of 129 million dollars a year<span class="superscript">[1]</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
          This data, becoming more and more significant as years went by is why
          Canada stopped producing its one cent coin in 2012. These countries
          should be models to the United States moving forwards.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">A Solution</h1>

      <p>
        Before, it was mentioned that the nickel resulted in negative seigniorage
         at the US Mint in addition to the penny. Assuming that removing the five
          cent piece is not an option, as the economic costs are not as well known
           as that of the penny, there exists a solution that solves the problem
           of the penny and that of the negative seigniorage. Instead of ceasing
           the production of the penny, which has a relatively low cost of
           production compared to the other coins when not compared to face value,
            the minting of nickels could halt. Then, pennies would have the value
             of nickels, and nickels already in circulation would still be legal
              tender, while banks collect them over time, selling them to the US
               Mint for melting. The effect of this would be that the five cent
                coin, at least in the short term, no longer produces negative
                seigniorage and that there is no one cent coin wasting people&#39;s
                 time. There is the cost of heightened inflation with such a
                 solution, but the cost is easily overtaken by the savings
                 generated annually from such an act<span class="superscript">[4]</span>.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head"> Lombra&#39;s Counterargument</h1>

        <p>
           Whenever the abolition of the penny is brought up, Raymond Lombra&#39;s
           argument is the most credible research based paper of the opposition,
           so it is prudent to analyze this argument. Lombra, of Penn. State
           University argued in a famous paper from 2001 that eliminating the
           penny from the US coinage system would have an immediate effect on
           consumers and disproportionately affect poorer areas of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lombra begins with a data collection of nearly 4000 items and their
          prices from a chain convenience store, finding that nearly 82 percent
          of them have a price ending in 9. He then simulates 5000 transactions
          between one and three items from the above list and implements rounding
          to predict how rounding would affect consumers. Lombra found that
          between 60 and 90 percent of these transactions rounded up, resulting
          in a loss for consumers<span class="superscript">[5]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next issue Lombra brings up is that the elimination of the penny
          would increase prices. Due to the above <q>rounding tax</q> when taken
          against the total spending of American consumers, the rounding would
          increase prices by .01 of a percent per year. Lombra argues that while
          on individual prices, the difference is un-noticeable, the sum of the
          effect raises prices significantly<span class="superscript">[5]</span>.
        </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">Rebuttal</h1>
      <p>
          The primary issue with Lombra&#39;s argument is the date of publication.
          2001 was a long time ago and there has been a lot of research since on
          the topic. It was determined that the simulations that Lombra ran were
          not representative of the purchases of real consumers. Additionally,
          Lombra failed to include sales tax in his calculations. Only 2.5
          percent of Americans shop without sales tax, not representative of the
          purchasing base. Whaples argued in 2007 that with the inclusion of
          sales tax completely erases the distribution that Lombra found. Whaples
          analyzed 185 thousand transactions across twenty stores across America,
          and found the opposite findings of Lombra. Instead of the consumer losing
          out on these transactions, it was found that the customers earned 105.6
          dollars. Of course, this is not any major money exchange, only about
          one-twentieth of a cent per transaction. The loss to the store is not
          significant either, only about 75 cents per day. In the state with the
          worst case, Pennsylvania which is one state where the consumer does
          lose out on rounding - an astounding one cent for every 67
          transactions. These stores come from a variety of socio-economic
          areas, and so these results are not affected by social status<span class="superscript">[6]</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
          To address Lombra&#39;s concern regarding the increase in prices, the
          value discussed cannot be accurate. The increase in prices was assumed
          due to the rounding tax that was believed to have existed. However,
          because this tax could not be supported, it stands to reason that this
          inflation would not occur. Even if this inflation did happen for some
          unseen variable one time, at a level that would not affect the economy.
          The Consumer Price Index, which is reported by the Bureau of Labor
          Statistics only reports data to the first decimal point, so the 1/100
          of a percent increase would not be reported in most cases. This
          indicates that the change is so insignificant as to not matter<span class="superscript">[6]</span>.
      </p>

    <h1 class="essay_head">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Due to the seigniorage of the coin and the effect on consumers, it is
        time to rid the United States of its lowest denomination coin. It makes
        sense now, and has made sense for many years now, and the fact that it
        has not is embarrassing. Strong capitalist policy is the signature of the
        United States and balancing the budget is important to everyone. If the
        country was serious about it, perhaps it would consider such wasteful
        spending as no longer necessary. Almost nowhere else does Congress
        consistently vote to throw away money in such a direct manner. Minting
        the penny is simply wasting money - to have the opportunity to lose more money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other solution to combat these effects is simply a short term band-aid
        that does nothing in the long term. This is a problem that is easily dealt
        with now and so should be done so. There is no reason to hold off on such
        a simple solution.

        The first change was to the background color of the body. I didn't like
        the plain white, but I do like the softness of white, and pastel colors
        fit that bill. I went with a light peach color, going with hex values because
        I like those better. After that, I wrapped the essay in a div so I could
        change its properties easily, and because I couldn't get the body to color
        only within its border. I gave the essay a "deep peach" color, to match with the
        background while keeping with an almost papery feel. My goal for the feel of
        the page to be reminiscent of paper, while retaining the elements of the computer.
        That's why I wrapped a border around the essay, and padded it out, so the
        text wouldn't be right next to the border. I also made the width of the essay
        div to be half of that of the body, to further the paper vibe.
    </p>

      As for the headers, I changed most of them to h1 tags, and in general did the
      same thing for all of them. I changed the size to represent the essay standard.
      For the subtitle, I removed the bold of the header. For the intro section with
      the title and the contact info, I wrapped it in a div in order to center all of the
      text. The first tough aspect of the change was the superscript. I had to align the
      text to the value super, then, lower the font size, and change the line height to be normal.
      Otherwise it messed with lines too much.
    </p>

      For the table, I wrapped it and all of the elements in a border, but collapsed
      it so that there wouldn't be double borders in places. I also centered the text. 
      Then, to make the table stand out a bit more, I made every other table row
      a slightly darker color. Next for the image, I reduced its size to be the width
      of the essay div, and made its caption bold via css instead of html.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry for the essay btw, only a few other small changes. I couldn't figure out a
      way for quotes to simply appear in text without the q tag, so I left that,
      only ensuring that the quotes would be "" in all browsers. Links I made sure could
      break their line so they wouldn't extent beyond the essay's border, and I gave
      each paragraph an indent because it looked wrong otherwise.
